My personal utility library. 
This repo is for educate myself about c++ and graphic. so don't expect too much, right? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: but still i will actively develop this library for a while

The library contain utility such as:
 - Common Data Representation
 - Simple Entity System
 - Cross-Platfrom Graphic Library (D3D9, D3D11, OPENGL, OPENGL-ES, VULKAN) (WIP)
 - Simple Cross-Platform Windowing System (WIP)
 - Simple Cross-Platform Threading System 
 
 I also use some 3rdParty for this library such as:
  - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
  - [thread.h](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/libs/blob/master/thread.h) (I renamed to portable_thread.h for this project)

I hope this library can be usefull for your project too. Happy Coding! :smile:
